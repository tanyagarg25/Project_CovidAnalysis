**Project Title**
COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis: Trends, Impact, and Forecasting

**Executive Summary**
**Objective:**
This project aimed to analyze COVID-19 data to uncover trends, assess regional impacts, and forecast future trends. The goal was to support public health strategies and optimize resource allocation.

**Context:**
The analysis used SQL for querying and processing data, and Tableau for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards. The SQL queries were designed to aggregate and prepare data, while Tableau provided insights through detailed visualizations.

**Business Problem**
**Problem Identification:**
The COVID-19 pandemic required a detailed understanding of its progression and impact. Effective analysis was needed to provide insights and support decision-making for public health and resource management.

**Business Impact:**
Limited insights hindered effective public health responses and resource allocation. Accurate and timely analysis was crucial for improving intervention strategies and preparing healthcare systems.

**Methodology**
**Data Cleaning & Transformation:**

**SQL:** Used SQL queries to extract, clean, and aggregate data from various sources. This involved addressing missing values, standardizing formats, and merging datasets.
Analysis Techniques:

**Tableau:** Utilized Tableau to create interactive dashboards that visualized trends, regional impacts, and forecasts. Tableau was employed for visual analysis, including trend lines, heat maps, and other graphical representations.
